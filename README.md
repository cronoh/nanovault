- [NanoVault](https://github.com/cronoh/nanovault) - The main wallet application (UI + Seed Generation/Block Signing/Etc).
- [NanoVault-Server](https://github.com/cronoh/nanovault-server) - Serves the Wallet UI and brokers public communication between the wallet and the Nano Node.
- [NanoVault-WS](https://github.com/cronoh/nanovault-ws) - Websocket server that receives new blocks from the Nano node and sends them in real time to the wallet ui.
